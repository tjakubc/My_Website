    <h1 class="Header1">My career History</h1>
    <h2 class="Header2">Hire date: July 9, 2012</h2>
    <p class="body_text">Intranet Solutions Intern</p>
    <p class="body_text2">I was invited to join the team as an intern, beginning on May 1 of this year, giving me just under 6 months on-the-job experience with the team. In this time, I have learned a tremendous amount about programming and reporting and plan to continue my education in this field.</p>
    <p class="body_text">Deposits</p>
    <p class="body_text2">I was moved over to the Deposits department in January of 2018 to assist with reporting and department organization. I was soon "loaned out" to many departments including IRA, DPL, BFU, and CEG to assist with a variety of reports and issues that came up. In addition, my skills were utilized to enhance the back-office tasks to increase performance and decrease wasted time.</p>
    <p class="body_text">Home Equity</p>
    <p class="body_text2">When our Home Equity department was first starting up back in January of 2016, I was moved over to help manage a team of banker assistants as well as help review a major legal issue that came up around RESPA requirements. Once that was managed, I was moved into a reporting roll with Tim Makofske to provide stats for the department.</p>
    <p class="body_text">STU / CEG / Admin</p>
    <p class="body_text2">Prior to being moved over to Home Equity, I was placed in a temporary roll for about 5 months where I assisted the Service to Usage teams and the CEG teams as a mid-shift coach. In addition to coaching agents and providing data around a variety of problems and reports, I was also assisting the Admin for the department with a variety of tasks including budgeting, meeting notes, hierarchy updates, etc.</p>
    <p class="body_text">ISU Coach</p>
    <p class="body_text2">From May of 2014 through August of 2015 I was a coach in the training department for card services. I developed a variety of Job Aids to assist the new hires and assessments in excel that once the agents took them, would be auto graded and results sent back to them.</p>
    <p class="body_text">Card Agent</p>
    <p class="body_text2">My Discover career started in July of 2012 as a servicing agent in card. I spent just over a year in this roll before being promoted into the coach position. During this time I was moved around to about 4 different teams, each of which was a more experienced team than the prior.</p>
