    <h1 class="Header1">Education</h1>
    <h2 class="Header2">Courses</h2>
    <p class="body_text">College</p>
    <p class="body_text2">I completed an Intermediate Microsoft Excel course from Scottsdale Community College which included Visual Basics and advanced formulas which helped me to develop a wide variety of reports here at Discover.</p>
    <p class="body_text">Code with Mosh</p>
    <p class="body_text2">The first course I took through Code with Mosh was the Complete SQL Mastery. This 11 hour course taught me how to write and read SQL queries and introduces me to a wide variety of functions and events.
        <br>
        <br>Next I completed the HTML5 and CSS3 course. After watching 14 hours of video, taking about 10 hours of notes and reading about 12 hours of online materials, I was able to put on the hat of the architect and the artist to design my first webpage, that you are viewing now!
        <br>
        <br>My next adventure was to complete the 6 hour JavaScript course to learn the wizardry that goes on behind the scenes. This course helped to tie together the actions that can be completed including the concept of performing a single action in different ways using polymorphism, hot reloading to be able to see changes in a "live" state, and how an object can inherit properties from another object. 
        <br>
        <br>The next course I will tackle is Git and then React.</p>
    <p class="body_text">Code Academy</p>
    <p class="body_text2">I completed the SQL course so far and I plan on completing the free JavaScript and HTML courses as well as any others that come up that well benefit me in my current job role.</p>
    <h2 class="Header2">On-The-Job</h2>
    <p class="body_text">Historical</p>
    <p class="body_text2">I have worked for my parents for the past 15 years part time doing admin work for both of their businesses. What I can bring to Discover is extensive knowledge of SOP creation, digital file organization, and record maintenance for a salt water fish and coral business, real-estate, and a handyman company.</p>
    <p class="body_text">Current</p>
    <p class="body_text2">In the past 5 months, I have been able to dedicate a decent amount of time to shadowing my team and learning a variety of different processes by watching my team work tickets and complete tasks. I have been able to solidify my SQL training and perfect my Tableau knowledge. There are countless hours I can and plan on spending with our team as I feel that real world experiences are one the best ways to learn!
